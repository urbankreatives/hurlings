They will normally be required to complete the school\u2019s own tests for overseas\u00a0students in English and Mathematics. Selection will be based on performance in these tests and on a report from the student\u2019s current school. Other criteria set out in this Admissions Policy will apply equally to\u00a0students from overseas.<\/p>\n<h3>Entry<\/h3>\n<p>In the Preparatory School, entry is usually into Nursery (Early Years) (age 3), Reception (age 4) or Year 3 (age 7).<\/p>\n<p>In the Senior School entry is normally at age 11, 13 or 16, into Year 7, Year 9 or Year 12 respectively.<\/p>\n<h3>Selection Criteria<\/h3>\n<p>Selection for entry in any part of the school will be made on the basis of performance in entrance tests, the impression made during interview and\/or a trial day, and on reports from the prospective student\u2019s current school. The single most important criterion used for selection, however, is that the prospective student should be able to meet and maintain the standards required by the school for all its students and should feel comfortable with the ethos to which the school aspires. In cases in which other factors are equal, preference may first be given to a sibling of an existing student.<\/p>\n<p>For entry to the Senior School, preference may first be given to an existing Preparatory School pupil. For entry into the Sixth Form,\u00a0students will be expected to have achieved a minimum of 6 GCSE passes at Grades 9 \u2013 4 (or their equivalent).<\/p>\n<h3>Academic Standards<\/h3>\n<p>At Beechwood we strive to achieve the best possible academic results for every student. Teachers are generous of their time in supporting students, and in stretching the most-able, ensuring that all students reach their full potential. Our value-added record is remarkable with measurements showing that, on average, students gain more than one grade higher in GCSE examinations than predicted by their baseline tests at age 11.<\/p>\n<p>At A-level, our students often exceed expectations, with all leavers gaining places on their chosen courses in Higher Education.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Beechwood welcomes boys and girls with a range of academic abilities.
