As ever we continue to delight in the successes of our pupils, whose grades have facilitated their transition to a wonderful range of universities and courses. Margaret is off to Kent and Medway Medical School to study Medicine, Kristian is going to Durham University to study Law and Alex has secured a place at the University of Cambridge to study Classics. Callum is going to Durham University to study Modern Languages and Cultures and James who secured 3 A* grades has secured a place at the University of Sheffield to study Philosophy, Religion and Ethics. Pupils have won places at Universities from York to Plymouth and across the country. 80% of Beechwood students have gained places in their first choice University.<br \/>\nThere is a debt of gratitude owed by all to the Parents and the Teachers at Beechwood School who have gone above and beyond in their support and encouragement over what has to be described as a difficult period in our history. Congratulations to all students on their achievements and we wish you all the best in your future.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Paul Kershaw<br \/>\nDeputy Head<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/6th-9-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-15945\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/6th-9-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/6th-9-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/6th-9-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/6th-9-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/6th-9-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/> <\/p>\n<p class=\"twkmedia_intro_text\">Being a member of the Sixth Form will usher in a new phase in your life and will feel different from anything you have experienced at school so far.<\/p>\n<p>Your relationships with your teachers will change, as you will be expected and encouraged to take more responsibility for your own learning. Your tutors will work closely with you to help you to develop both academically and as a person making sure you achieve your very best.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/6th-brochure-3-1.pdf\">SIXTH FORM PROSPECTUS<\/a><\/p>\n<p>As a school, we will work with you to explore the best post-16 combinations of courses, whether that be a full suite of A Levels or a combination of A Levels and other Level 3 Qualifications.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Leavers-Destinations-2022.pdf\">LEAVERS DESTINATIONS 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Leavers-Destinations-2021.pdf\">LEAVERS&#8217; DESTINATIONS 2021<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This,will enable your son\/daughter to maximise their 6th Form studies and have excellent &#8216;wrap-around&#8217; skills in preparation for university or work placements.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the Sixth Form, you will have more freedom, but with the added responsibility of being a respected senior member of the school. You will have more choice of what to wear, take more control over your own time and have the use of the Sixth Form common room and its facilities. This is a time for making preparations for your life beyond school by learning to balance responsibilities and freedom.<\/p>\n<p>The last two years at school are the most important in any student\u2019s school career. Results achieved in A-level examinations determine much more than just a choice of university course. The entire direction of the rest of your life can be affected by decisions made at this crucial stage. Your final two years at school will shape your future, allowing you to fulfil your ambitions and to succeed at whatever you choose in the years to come.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Mr M Awdry (Head of 6th Form)<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A LEVEL RESULTS 2022 Students across Year 13 have had their hard work and tenacity rewarded with some outstanding results.
