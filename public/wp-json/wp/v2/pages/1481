We want the children to possess the right sort of confidence and to be prepared for a rapidly changing world. Part of that preparation will involve skills in public speaking, problem solving, lateral thinking, the ability to communicate, to adapt, to present and to hold a conversation.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In\u00a0Pre-Prep and Reception the children are encouraged to become <strong>independent learners<\/strong> and <strong>thinkers.<\/strong> They work collaboratively and independently and are discovering their unique learning styles and habits: a blue-print for their entire learning journey. The roles and responsibilities increase as the children grow through the school.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Form Captains<\/strong> and <strong>Vice Captains<\/strong> in each class, from Reception to Year 5, take on various tasks and responsibilities. The positions change termly so that everyone is involved. The elected children sit on a\u00a0<strong>School Council <\/strong>that meets termly and represent their peers.<\/li>\n<li>Year 3 and 4 engage in team building activities and <strong>camp out<\/strong> in the school grounds. Year 5 a have a PGL <strong>team building<\/strong> and leadership week and Year 6 have an <strong>outward-bound<\/strong> activity week at Hayling Island.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Team Captains<\/strong> and <strong>House Captains<\/strong> organise sports and arts events, make choices and decisions, delegate tasks, plan teams with teachers and lead team talks.<\/li>\n<li>Year 5 <strong>Buddies<\/strong> plan the pupil rota, ensure break-time is covered and that the juniors have play-mates. They are listeners and friends in the playground and they take this role very seriously.<\/li>\n<li>Year 6 <strong>Prefects<\/strong> have a range of designated responsibilities and daily duties. Year 6 pupils guide visitors and Parents on Open Days, they meet and greet at school events and escort juniors at morning drop-off. The <strong>Head Boy<\/strong>\u00a0or<strong>\u00a0Girl<\/strong> oversees the Prefects, make speeches at public events, lead meetings and help organise various events. The <strong>Head of Houses<\/strong> are responsible for organising\u00a0their respective\u00a0charity\u00a0fund raising days\u00a0and help organise inter-house events.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Year 6 pupils participate in an annual two day <strong>Enterprise Challenge<\/strong> involving many local junior schools. They have seminars and workshops with visiting business leaders and engage in product research, marketing, strategy development, creative thinking, presentations and pitches and working effectively in teams.<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.69px;\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We aim to provide opportunities for each pupil to discover and nurture talents through a wide range of experiences and challenges.
