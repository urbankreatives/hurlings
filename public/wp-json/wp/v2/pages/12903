From September, the Prep School classrooms will be re-located into Beechwood House, the main school building.The Prep children will benefit from the use of the senior school specialist spaces whilst enjoying a more cohesive, traditional Prep experience within the House. Educationally, we will be absolutely clear with our vision for Prep \u2013a happy, supportive environment which leads to the very best individual academic outcomes for  maximum  choice at Year  Six,  whether  at  Beechwood  or via  successful 11+  into  a  local  Grammar.

Pre-application planning meetings have already taken place and the new building will be located on the lawn beneath the  MUGA with  access  from  Hall\u2019s  Hole  Road and potentially a  new traffic  flow  through  the campus.  We are eager to build as soon as planning permission is obtained (which may be by January 2022) and are sure that our families and younger children will absolutely love the space.<br \/>\nPending planning approvals, the Outdoor classroom and Music buildings are being redeveloped to house our current Pre School children. We hope to have the new Nursery up-and-running before the end of the next academic year.  Whilst very much an overview of the first phase,we think this should show the exciting direction in which we are hoping to take the school. Next steps in the vision include a brand-new D&#038;T centre, an outdoor decking area flowing from the dining room and other elements with which to enhance Beechwood. We  hope you  find  this first glimpse  into  our  vision  for  Beechwood as  exciting  as  we  do and  look forward to sharing with you more as the works begin.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ali-Khan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"164\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14949\" \/><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Alpha-210x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14859\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Alpha-210x300.jpg 210w, https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Alpha.jpg 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Message from Ali Khan, Chair of Governors &amp; Director of Alpha Schools Group Ever since our involvement with Beechwood began, we have&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1083,"featured_media":14937,"parent":0,"menu_order":98,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.7.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>New Vision for Beechwood - Beechwood<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"We are pleased now to be able to share some exciting news for Beechwood\u2019s future.
