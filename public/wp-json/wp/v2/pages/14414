I have been amazed at how confident and independent my son has become since starting.&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Pastoral care of our children is at the forefront of all we do, and we understand how important it is to build a positive and strong relationship with our children, their families, and extended families from the outset.<\/p>\n<p>Our highly trained and experienced staff offer every child the opportunity to learn and experience something new every day, be that in the classroom or outside within our fabulous grounds. Our specialist provision also includes ensuring that children begin to learn phonics and Maths confidently in preparation for Pre-Prep, as well as participating in structured and guided play.<\/p>\n<p>We understand all children learn and develop differently and at their own pace. Every child is treated as an individual and, together with their assigned keyworker, is taught around their ability and interests. We have high behavioral expectations of our children, promoting good manners, teamwork, respect, and kindness. All of which our children have in abundance and support their personal, social, and emotional development.<\/p>\n<p>With exceptional indoor and outdoor learning environments we nurture our children\u2019s curiosity and imagination. Together with our comprehensive and creative curriculum we help every child reach their maximum potential, becoming a confident and resilient learner in preparation for a seamless transition to the Reception class in Pre-Prep.<\/p>\n<p>Being part of an exceptional Prep-school gives us access to specialised teachers and our children have weekly PE, Music, Cookery and Forest School lessons as part of the Pre-School curriculum. In addition to this we also offer a wide range of other subjects such as Languages, Ballet and Piano as extra-curricular activities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Open 50 weeks a year from 8.00am &#8211; 3.30pm, with optional wrap around care starting at 7.30am and concluding at 6.00pm, we&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1083,"featured_media":14652,"parent":9164,"menu_order":2,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.7.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Pre-School in Tunbridge Wells - Beechwood School<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Discover our wonderful Pre-School at Beechwood.
