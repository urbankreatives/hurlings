Happiness, security and confidence are paramount for each child to achieve, learn and succeed. <\/p>\n<p>We have created the solid foundations of a \u2018Pastoral School\u2019 by developing individual Learning Behaviours from Year 7 upwards; promoting the language and behaviour that form the basis for a broad curriculum, tailored, where appropriate, to individual needs.  We believe that pupil respect for the school&#8217;s Code of Conduct and our Uniform Policy are key elements towards pupils&#8217; personal development.<\/p>\n<p><a class =\"btn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beechwood-Code-Senior-School-2.pdf\">Beechwood Code Senior School<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a class =\"btn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.beechwood.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/Senior-Uniform-2022-2023-2.pdf\">Senior Uniform 2022-2023<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The pastoral structure is a support network which looks after the children and the staff:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Form Tutors<\/strong> \u2013 look after small classes and genuinely know their pupils. Communication between home and school is frequent and supportive. Form time each morning enables a strong link between the pupils and the Form Tutor. <\/p>\n<p><strong>PSCHE<\/strong> &#8211; The Personal Social Citizenship and Health Education programme affords a regular space within the curriculum for every pupil to develop the essential personal, social and critical-thinking skills they need to successfully and safely navigate their worlds.  Common to the programme of study for every year group is our focus on personal health, both physical (including sexual), mental and financial, citizenship and our role within our communities and families, as well as our responsibilities to society (in its global scope) as a whole.  There is an emphasis throughout on critical matters of safety, both physical and mental, including much coverage of the critical issue of the safety of children\u2019s digital lives, gender relationships and LBGT+ understanding. At different stages of a child\u2019s passage through school, sessions will be tailored to match the stage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Houses<\/strong> \u2013 provide a second layer of pastoral support. Vertical integration from Year 7 to Year 13 means children across the age groups and the year groups mix and get to know each other. The youngest look up to the older children as role models and the older children look after the juniors. Each House has a Captain and Vice Captain who help to organise events and each class has a Form Captain and Vice Captain, all gradually taking on roles and responsibilities as they move through the school. Each House also has teachers helping give leadership.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pastoral Care is a real strength across the Senior School and every child is known and understood.
