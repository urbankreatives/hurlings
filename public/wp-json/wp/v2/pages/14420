We also provide milk and water.<\/p>\n<p>Our children have access to free flow throughout their sessions to enjoy time both indoors and outside in our designated play area.<\/p>\n<p>At 12.00 noon the children eat lunch in our refectory seated with their teachers to promote good table manners and to ensure the children eat well.<\/p>\n<p>At 1.00pm our morning session finishes and those children going home are collected from the Pre-School. The remaining children enjoy playtime with the Reception class until 1.30pm.<\/p>\n<p>During the afternoon the children enjoy a range of activities, child initiated, and adult led.
